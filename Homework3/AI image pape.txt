For my AI image, I used ChatGPT. I chose it because Iâ€™m most familiar with it and already had a login, so it seemed the easiest option. I gave it an open-ended prompt, asking it to create an image a Gen Z person would find funny. The AI created a pretty expected result, using a video game controller with a funny animal. However, the AI actually impressed me by making fully legible words on a neon sign. This was unexpected because AI is usually pretty awful at creating words. It would be interesting to compare the DALL-E image generator and DeepSeek, its newest competitor, to see if there is a big difference.
